### Spotify Process, 12:20 PM

I'm watching this [amazing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvfz4HGtoPc) right now that #Spotify put out about how they approach engineering and design, it's goddamn amazing.

Some of the devs here at #Hivewire are onboard with this style of development. #Tel just mentioned in #Slack that we should have a talk to discuss this.

The first thing that came to my mind was to talk about all of the failure that I saw at #Agrian; there were so many. I need to spend some time soon talking about all of the failtures that I witnessed there, think about how they could have been avoided, and prepare how to communicate all of this to the #Hivewire team.
