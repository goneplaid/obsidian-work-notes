### Things to do in Hivewire

The following items are areas of interest in Hivewire and should definitely be pursed for personal satisfaction and as meaningful contributions to the software, in an effort to help shepherd it along in a very cometitive, team-oriented, start-up atmosphere. 

Mark these off as you beging to generate work around them, as in, "in progress...":


- [ ] I want to implement a feature across the stack, taking care of both front and back  end concerns. I want a new chart type:
	-  A Big Number component
	-  This is seriously a dead simple component but would give me a nice excuse to touch other parts of the system.
- [ ] Compile a mind-map in Obsidian of the fronend eco-system of Hivewire.
	-  Seriously, do this. It will give you a very good grasp of how everything is organized, why and where.
	-  Maybe do some system drawings while you're at it with all of those expensive-ass colored pens you bought.
- [ ] Do more systems drawing for Hivewire + Gardening
	-  Draw out some forms and recreate those in the software.
	-  Divide up all of the areas of information and organize them into groups, like sections on a form, for the above task
