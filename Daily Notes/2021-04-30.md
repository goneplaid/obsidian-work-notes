### 8:19 PM, Sliding Menu Component

Create a component for things like toolbar and canvas headers that allows a very easy to build, responsive, bullet-proof menu layout.

I was looking at how responsive menus work in some other software, like in gmail and something else that I can't remember, and I had an idea about creating a set of components that can facilitate a really smooth experience when dealing with collapsing viewport sizes.

If the user compresses the width of their browser window, we should have icons and other inputs organized into panel components that will have priorities within a larger single-row-based container.

Some will slide under other panels and otherwise disappear as a given viewport gets smaller, lending the screen real estate to other, declared and prioritized panels.

We could use this opportunity to make some bulletproof UI components that should be robust enough for a possible long-term presence in the software.
