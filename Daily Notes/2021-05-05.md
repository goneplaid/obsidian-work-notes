### 11:07 AM, Kanban Planning

So far I've created two components:
- `<KanbanItem />`
- `<LaneHeader />`

I think we might need another component for possibly managing all of the individual lanes...

Let's call the main component, `<KanbanBoard />`

We're definitely going to need a `<KanbanLane />` component. See the story for the `<SortableList />` component. There's a separate component used for each lane, a card. Each `<SortableList />` within that has an array of other lists that they will accept items from. We need a parent component to set those up and manage them.
