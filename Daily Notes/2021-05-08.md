### 1:49 PM - New Idea!

It would be really neat if we could use custom route actions that could take a user to a specific part of the system after a given process/action/condition. Like a specific workspace/channel/page.

Let turn this into a fun kind of hyper card system!


### Another idea!

Since we're into SUPER custom things for users, what if we did more with leveraging things that we can prefab for people using our own tools, and then construct the application with that? Things like that would go along way in building the tool in a way that users can directly learn from and emulate. We provide some prefab, default tools but the user can dig into those, learn, and then come up with their own amazing stuff.
