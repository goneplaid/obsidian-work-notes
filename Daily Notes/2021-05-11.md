### Current Status

We now have a basic demo in place under `<SortableList2>`. It's implementing the two most basic use cases, a vertical and a horizontal single-list layout.

We're going to have to make some drastic changes, however, in order to get it to be able to work in a multi-list layout. There's also a number of new features that exist in the new library that we can incorporate into our implementation. These are additional changes that we'll have to work into this effort.

### Next Changes

#### Refactor render function into component
