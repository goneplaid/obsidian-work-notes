# Sortable List Planning

### Current Status

We now have a basic demo in place under `<SortableList2>`. It's implementing the two most basic use cases, a vertical and a horizontal single-list layout.

We're going to have to make some drastic changes, however, in order to get it to be able to work in a multi-list layout. There's also a number of new features that exist in the new library that we can incorporate into our implementation. These are additional changes that we'll have to work into this effort.

### Next Changes... 10:06 PM

Woowwwwww, what a shitty today. My brain wasn't being friendly and I didn't feel productive and did a lot of flailing. However, I am feeling a bit better tonight and am groking some decent things by still reading over the code in the dnd repo, still.

I just commited the basic shape of things as they are now and am ready to start making more direct, targeted commits by taking on super specific functionality at each pass. I need to be more deliberate with this and not fall into any rabbit holes.


### Fuck

- Don't use ActiveID in BOTH the list and the canvas. Only use it in the canvas.
- Stop trying to do so many things in both the list and the canvas
