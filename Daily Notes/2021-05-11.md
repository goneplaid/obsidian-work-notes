# Sortable List Planning

### Current Status

We now have a basic demo in place under `<SortableList2>`. It's implementing the two most basic use cases, a vertical and a horizontal single-list layout.

We're going to have to make some drastic changes, however, in order to get it to be able to work in a multi-list layout. There's also a number of new features that exist in the new library that we can incorporate into our implementation. These are additional changes that we'll have to work into this effort.

### Next Changes

#### Refactor render function into component

We need to open up the layout. Right now it's closed as a single render function is accepted. We need to create a public component, `<SortableItem>` that devs can use that isn't internal to the list. Let devs create a `map()` around `<SortableItem>`. This should be our very next refactoring.

#### After that ðŸ‘†

Create a new component called, `<SortableCanvas>` that will house the `<DndContext>` component. This will be used for laying out multiple, droppable lists.
