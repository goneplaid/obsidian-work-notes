### Stationary property

We can easily make the sortable list items stationary by allowing
a flag to be set as a prop. If we set it to true, items can become
stationary. We do this by not passing in the coordinate values
generated as the user moves their mouse and drags an item.

WAIT

We ARE giong to have to change it. As the user drags their mouse,
the "over" algorithm moves things from one list to another; we would
have to prevent it from doing that. However, a stationary/static view
as the user moves their mouse might be easy to implement.
