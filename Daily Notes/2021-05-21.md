### More Kanban TODO Items

- [ ] Wire up drag-hovers to the `<KanbanLane>` component.
- [ ] Do scrolling (vertical and horizontal).
- [ ] Make the kanban actually save/update items.
- [ ] Build the new item form so we can create new items.

- [ ] Show display when there are too many items to display.
