### Scorecards!

#### Initial Planning

First things first, where to store this stuff? #Jacob brought up a good piece of info about how the table structure is going to change once we get the new Mosaic component online. Instead of appending a new key to the existing `layout` field/structure in the table, we'll instead just add a new field:

> `scorecards: string[]`

This will just store a string of the component IDs for each Scorecard.

The individual scorecard configs will live in the `components` table along with all other component configs.
