### Final Scorecard Changes & Fixes Needed

- [x] With no cards shown, toggling the feature toggle shows that extra space is created. Eliminate that space.
- [x] Obtain the dataset color and set this as soon as the user selects or changes the dataset
- [x] Divide the component up into two, one with the visual stuff (card, color, title) and a second, inner component, that will dipslay the requested value.
- [x] Make the config show up the right of a card so it doesn't block shit.
- [x] Fix the dragged-overlay when the users cursor gets into scorecard drop area. Looks like shit. Figure out why the UI for that gets so screwed up.
- [ ] Allow users to edit the title
- [x] Try to fix the badge and adjust its z-index so that it doesn't bleed into the config cards
- [x] Add a progress bar to scorecards for percentages
- [x] Finish formatting returned values
- [ ] Fix the display of scorecards within pages so that scorecards don't persist across multiple pages
- [x]  Fix bug that leaves initial blue drop area when you drag out of the drop area and essentially cancel the creation of a new card
- [ ]  Add delete and copy component actions to the scorecard config
