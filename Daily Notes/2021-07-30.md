### Final To Do List - Scorecards


- [x] Disable dragging when editing titles (in case the user wants to highlight some of the text)
- [x] Disallow carriage returns when editing titles; make typing enter save the edit
- [ ] Ask Matt about making scorecard values right-aligned
- [x] Fix the hiding of the menu after the user first adds it
- [x] Don't allow multiple configs to be open at once
- [x] Prevent text from being selected when dragging cards
- [x] Hide the components menu when scorecards have been added




- [ ] Configs showing in top left corner, set opacity on that 
- [ ] Fix icon alignment in New Scorecard Button/Draggable
- [ ] New Scorecard drag-out is kinda broke
- [ ] Use EditText and make it more generic, use on Kanban also
- [ ] Turn on throttling, move Suspense inside controller
- [ ] Spacing on numbers, fix
- [ ] Use opacity on gear icon for config, don't conditionally show it
