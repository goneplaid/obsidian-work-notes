### Copy Scorecards

Changes needed...

* We need to create separate lists for each individual component in the copied components area
* This will also require that we change how we maintain the scorecard arrays in the main Workspace component... each copied scorecard will need it's own entry in the scorecards TS Record type
* The user will drag over copied items in the exact same way that they drag over new scorecards now, except that when dropped, a new component will be created.
	* This should be very easy to clone based on how new scorecards are created.
