### Purpose

I want to use Hivewire to create a tool to aid me in gardening. I really need a project to drive my usage of it so I can learn the ins and outs of it. This is _incredibly_ important. 


### Things to do/track

#### Plants

- Purchased
	- Store the price and place purchased from
- Grown from seed
	- Store the dates of when you started seedlings
	- Store the date of when seedlings emerged
	- Store the date of transplantation

#### Seeds
- Keep track of seeds that you have

#### Garden Plots
