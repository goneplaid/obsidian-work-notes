Get into the habit of never doing data entry directly in a [[Dataset]].

Datasets will most likely contain all kinds of extraneous fields, such as lookup and link fields. They will get in the way.

Instead, try to create data-entry "dashboards" for each dataset or combination of datasets that you want to edit in a spreadsheet-like manner.
