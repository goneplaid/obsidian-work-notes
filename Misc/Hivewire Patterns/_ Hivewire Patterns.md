# Hivewire Patterns

This is the start of a new set of documents that I would like to start writing to document various patterns that I use when using Hivewire.

These patterns can be something as obvious as using a table component in a workspace for data entry over editing a dataset directly for some given advantage. This is to say that all patterns should have a decisive purpose and benefit for some given reason.

A pattern should not be created for something that lacks a contextual benefit.
