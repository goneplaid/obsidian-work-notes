#### Technical Ability

Assumptions

- I'm a seasoned web developer but am very new to react
- I am not as familiar with microservices as everyone else is around here
- I am solid on a lot of the foundational aspects of being a developer
- I understand many things very quickly

Goals


#### Interpersonal Skills

Assumptions

- I'm always very friendly and not assuming of people, ie, non-judgemental
- Sometimes I'm too quiet and feel like I might be missing out on some subtle, social nuances and/or activities
- I'm very approachable
- I'm very quiet in meetings as I feel like most people cover the things I want to say, so I can put more effort into paying attention to everyone instead of considering when it might be my turn to talk (I feel like that's way more important, but if something came up that no one else addressed; I would ask)
- 

#### Work Style

Assumptions

- I like to be in my own world and think through problems that I'm faced with; social problem-solving isn't my goto unless I actually need help
- I spend time thinking through a problem and trying to understand as many aspects of it as possible before I start writing actual code
-
