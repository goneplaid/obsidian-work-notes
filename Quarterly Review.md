#### Final Questions

- [ ] What's





#### Technical Ability

Assumptions

- I'm a veteren web developer but am very new to react
- I am not as familiar with microservices as everyone else is at Hivewire
- I am very comfortable with most of the foundational aspects of being a web developer
- I understand the gist of things fairly quickly but need more time to assimilate the many details
- It takes time for me to cultivate a solid understand of an entire ecosystem of services

Goals

- Read the microservices book
- Become more familiar with the backend systems at Hivewire
- Continue learning about the frontend/backend systems to the point where I can make meaningful architectural contributions to the frontend


#### Interpersonal Skills

Assumptions

- I'm always very friendly and not assuming of people, ie, non-judgemental
- Sometimes I'm too quiet and feel like I might be missing out on certain social happenings
- I'm very approachable
- I'm very quiet in meetings as I feel like most people cover the things I want to say, so I can put more effort into paying attention to everyone instead of considering when it might be my turn to talk (I feel like that's way more important, but if something came up that no one else addressed; I would ask)

Goals

- Become more social and foster closer relationships with my colleagues
- Be more engaging in meetings, if appropriate



#### Work Style

Assumptions

- I like to be in my own world and think through problems that I'm faced with; social problem-solving isn't my goto unless I actually need help
- I spend time thinking through a problem and trying to understand as many aspects of it as possible before I start writing actual code
